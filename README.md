# NoSQL & Big Data demonstration

This is a fun assignment I undertook to explore the world of NoSQL and Big Data.

## Overview

NoSQL databases, unlike relational databases, can handle semi-structured and unstructured data.

I also experimented with Hive data warehouse implementation as a kind of Big Data concept.

This repository is divided into six (6) sections: Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Hive DW.

<br>

## Section 1 - Redis

In this section, I explored working with the Redis database technology. 

Redis is a popular key-value pair kind of NoSQL database technology.

Redis uses its Redis CLI set of query commands for handling data.

## Section 2 - Cassandra

In this section, I explored working with the Cassandra database technology. 

Apache Cassandra is a widely used columnar kind of NoSQL database technology.

Cassandra uses its Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for handling data management.

## Section 3 - MongoDB

In this section, I explored working with the MongoDB database technology. 

MongoDB is a popularly used document-oriented NoSQL database technology.

MongoDB uses its MongoDB Query Language (MQL) for handling data management.

## Section 4 - JSON

In this section, I explored working with the JSON database technology. 

JSON is another widely used document-oriented NoSQL database technology.

JSON is a safer alternative to XML which is another document-oriented database.

## Section 5 - Neo4j

In this section, I explored working with the Neo4j database technology. 

Neo4j is a very popular graph database and an example of NoSQL technology.

MongoDB uses its Cypher Query Language (CQL) for handling data management.

## Section 6 - Hive DW

In this final section, I experimented with the Hive/Hadoop Big Data technology. 

Hadoop is a framework providing a platform for other applications to query/process Big Data.

Apache Hive is an SQL-based application that processes the data using Hive Query Language (HQL).

I need to mention here that this implementation on Hive is just to demonstrate code.

It's not necessarily about the output of the queries (which seem verbose and unorganized).
